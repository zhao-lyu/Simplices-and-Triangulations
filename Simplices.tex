    \subsection{Simplices}
    In this section, we will introduce simplices and talk about its geometrical properties, such as diameter and volume. These information and notation are mainly from \cite{ciarlet2002finite}\cite{bey2000simplicial}
    \noindent
    \begin{definition*}
    A $k$-simplex $T \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a $k$-dimensional convex hull of $k+1$ vertices ${x}_0, \cdots, {x}_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$, which are affinely independent.
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    {T} & = [{x}_0, \cdots, {x}_k ]\\
    & := \left\{{x} = \sum\limits_{i=0}^k \lambda_i {x}_i \Bigm| \sum\limits_{i=0}^k \lambda_i = 1 ~and~ 0 \leqslant \lambda_i \leqslant 1, 0 \leqslant i \leqslant k \right\}\\
    & := \left\{\lambda_0{x}_0 + \cdots + \lambda_k{x}_k \Bigm| \sum\limits_{i=0}^k \lambda_i = 1 ~and~ 0 \leqslant \lambda_i \leqslant 1, 0 \leqslant i \leqslant k \right\}.
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    \end{definition*}
    If $k = n$, we do not address the dimension of a $k$-simplex. 2-simplices are also called \emph{triangles}, and 3-simplices are called \emph{tetrahedra}.

    \begin{definition*}
    %\paragraph{Subsimplices}
    An  $l$-simplex ${S} = [{y}_0, \cdots, {y}_l]$ is called an \emph{$l$-subsimplices} of $k$-simplex ${T} = [{x}_0, \cdots, {x}_k]$, if indices $0 \leqslant {i}_0 \leqslant \cdots\leqslant{i}_l \leqslant k$ with ${y}_i = {x}_i$, for $0 \leqslant l \leqslant k \leqslant n$.
    \end{definition*}
    Since there are $k+1$ vertices in $k$-simplex $T$, and $l+1$ vertices in $l$-subsimplices $S$, the number of $l$-subsimplex of $k$-simplex is $\binom{k+1}{l+1}$.


    %\paragraph{Simplices Equality}
    Consider simplices $T = [{x}_0, \cdots, {x}_k]$ and $T' = [{y}_0, \cdots, {y}_k]$. We say these two simplices $T$ and $T'$ are equal, i.e. $T = T'$, if ${x}_i = {y}_i$ for $0 \leqslant i \leqslant k$. Note that the vertex ordering of simplex is fixed, so if two simplices $T$ and $T'$ denote the same set but with different vertex ordering, they are not equal; instead, we say that ${T}$ coincides with $T'$, i.e. $T \cong T'$.

    \paragraph{Simplex under Affine Transformation}\mbox{}\\
    Let $F$ be an affine transformation. 
    Instead of taking a single variable $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ for affine transformation, we can take a subset S $\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, which contains $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Then the transformed set $S'$ is
    \begin{equation*}
    S\textprime= \left\{{F}(x) ~|~ x\in S \right\}.
    \end{equation*}
    Similarly, if we regard a k-dimensional simplex ${T} = [{x_0, \cdots, x_k}]$ as a subset $\in\mathbb{R}^n$, then the image of ${T}$ under affine transformation is defined as
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    {F}({T}) = \big[{F}(x_0), \cdots , {F}(x_k)\big]
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    We can see that $F(T)$ is still a k-dimensional simplex. Let us write $T' = F(T)$. We might be curious about the relationship between simplices $T$ and $T'$. Since vertices of a simplex are in a specific given order, so different vertex ordering leads to different simplices. Therefore, there exists a unique affine transformation such that $T = T'$. Another important property of simplices is congruence.

    \begin{definition*}
    Two simplices $T$, $T'$ are defined to be congruent if they can be obtained from each other by rotation, mirroring, scaling, and translation, i.e. if there exists a scaling factor c $\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$, a translation vector $v\in\mathbb{R}^n$, and an orthogonal matrix $Q\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ such that
    \begin{equation*}
    T' = v + cQT
    \end{equation*}
    \end{definition*}
    \noindent
    When the two simplices $T, T'$ have same vertices but with different vertex ordering, we can translate it as $T' = F(T)$. Based on how we define the affine transformation, it is not hard to see that ${T} \cong {T}\textprime$. Then we say that ${T}$ and ${T}\textprime$ are in a same congruence class.
