%\subsection{Discussion}
Changing focus from 2 dimension to 3 dimension for mesh refinement, we confront with more challenges to preserve stability and consistency. In this section, we take a brief look at difficulties in applications of uniform refinement strategy and newest vertex bisection in 3 dimension.
