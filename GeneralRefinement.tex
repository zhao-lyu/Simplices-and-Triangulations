Suppose that a domain is divided into simplices. Mesh Refinement us a procedure of mesh modification in which we divide these simplices into smaller simplices. This process can be applied recursively to simplify some differential equations by generating smaller pieces of the domain. Let us first introduce triangulation to help understand refinement on a simplex. Generally speaking, we can think triangulation as a subdivision of a plane into triangles. Definition below is a more formal way to take when extending to higher dimension.
    \begin{definition*}
    A triangulation of $\mathbb R^n$ is subdivision into n-dimensional simplices such that intersection of any two simplices is either empty or sharing a common face, and any face of a simplex is in the triangulation.
    \end{definition*}
    Indeed, we say that this triangulation is consistent as it is not simply subdividing of a space. Moreover, the triangulation defined here can be treated equivalently as simplicial complex as it is a finite set of simplices satisfying
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[1.] Any face of a simplex from a triangulation is also in the triangulation
        \item[2.] The intersection of any two simplices $T_1, T_2 $ in a triangulation is a face of both $T_1$ and  $T_2$ or empty
    \end{itemize}
    (Denote triangulation same as simplicial complex $\mathcal{T}$)\\
    

    We can think a refinement of a simplex $T$ as a triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ which consists of smaller pieces of simplices of same type of the simplex $T$. Now consider a refinement of a simplicial complex. Let $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T'}$ be two different simplicial complex covering a same domain $\Omega$. This means that the domain \(\Omega = \displaystyle \bigcup({T \vert T\in \mathcal{T}}) = \bigcup({T' \vert T\in \mathcal{T'}})\). We say that $\mathcal{T'}$ is a refinement of $\mathcal{T}$ if each simplex $T\in\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T'}$ or the triangulation of $T$ is in $\mathcal{T'}$.

    As mentioned before, we may recursively apply a refinement strategy to help simplify some problems. By recursively taking refinement process from $\mathcal{T}_0$, we have a hierarchy triangulation $\mathcal{T}_k, k\in\mathbb{N}$, where $\mathcal{T}_k$ is a refinement of $\mathcal{T}_{k-1}$. 
    \begin{definition*}
    Let $\mathcal{T}_0$ be the initial simplicial complex in $\mathbb{R}^n$ where it starts from, then we define the hierarchy triangulation $\mathcal{T}_k$ as follows
    \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{T}_k := \bigcup\{refinement~of~simplex~T ~\vert ~T\in\mathcal{T}_{k-1}\}, \quad k\in\mathbb{N}
    \end{equation*}
    \end{definition*}

    \subsection{Stability of Refinement}
    \begin{definition*}
    We say a refinement strategy is $\textbf{stable}$ if there exists a constant $C >$ 0 such that $\mu(T)< C$ for all simplices $T$.
    \end{definition*}
    
    \begin{theorem*}
    If the number of congruence classes, obtained by applying the refinement of a non degenerate simplex $T$ initially, is finite, then the refinement strategy is stable.
    \end{theorem*}
    \begin{proof}
    %Idea:\\
    %1. $T_0$ is non-degenerate, then $\mathcal{T_0}$ is non-degenerate.\\
    
    We claim that
    a refinement strategy over initial simplicial complex $T_0$ produces only non-degenerate simplicies $T$.
    
    We prove this claim by induction.
    Clearly, the base case is true since it is given that all simplices $T$ in $\mathcal{T}$ are non-degenerate. For induction, suppose simplices in simplicial complex $\mathcal{T}_k$ is non-degenerate, i.e. given $C > 0, \mu(T) < C, ~\forall T \in\mathcal{T}_k$. Apply the refinement strategy on $\mathcal{T}_k$, and then we obtain $\mathcal{T}_{k+1} = \bigcup\{refinement~of~simplex~T ~\vert ~T\in\mathcal{T}_{k}\}, \quad k\in\mathbb{N}$. 
    %[connection???: f simplex $T_0 \in\mathcal{T}$ is non-degenerate, then simplicial complex $\mathcal{T}$ non-degenerate.]
    
    Next, we show the following fact.
    If the number of congruence classes is finite, then the number of shape measure is finite, and there exists a common bound $C > 0$ such that C $\geq \mu(\mathcal{T})$.
    
    This can be seen as follows.
    We proved that simplices in same congruence classes share the same shape measure. If we have finite number of congruence classes, clearly we have finite number of shape measure. When all simplices are non degenerate, we always have an upper bound for their shape measure $\mu(T)$. With the finite number of shape measure, we may set $C$ as the maximum of all upper bounds of shape measures. And therefore $C \geq \mu(\mathcal{T})$
    
    Since $T_0$ is non-degenerate, then $T_0$ is non-degenerate. Moreover, we know there exists a common bound $C$ for all shape measures since the number of congruence classes is finite. Therefore, we proved the stability.
    \end{proof}
    
    
    \subsection{Consistency of Refinement}
    We also want the triangulation after applying with a refinement to be consistent. This feature is proved in section 1.4 that if either 1) any face of a simplex from this triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ is also in $\mathcal{T}$, or 2) the intersection of any two simplices in a face of both simplices.
