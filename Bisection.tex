    \subsection{Newest Vertex Bisection Refinement in 2-dimension and its stability}
    Another popular refinement strategy is bisection. Basically, we cut a triangle by connecting one vertex, which we choose as the peak, with its opposite edge, which we call refinement edge. Generally, if we apply random bisection with no plan on a triangle, it is likely that we fail to preserve stability and consistency.

    Hence, one important part we need to consider is how to choose the peak for a triangle to preserve the stability and consistency, and one famous method was introduced as the $newest vertex$ bisection. In newest vertex bisection, we create the newest vertex at the middle of the refinement edge after applying the bisection refinement once, and then we regard the newest vertex as the peak for bisection over the resulting two smaller triangles.

    Observing Figure 5, we have a triangle at the beginning, say it's in congruency class 1. After applying the newest vertex bisection refinement once, we obtain two smaller pieces of triangles as in the second picture in Figure 5. Say one of them is in congruency class 2, and another one is in congruency class 3. Further applying the newest vertex bisection refinement, we have the figures below.

    \begin{claim}
    The left and right bottom triangles in Stage 3 are congruent to the original triangle in Stage 1, and they are in the congruency class 1. Moreover, the other two triangles left are congruent and in congruency class 4.
    \end{claim}
    %\begin{proof}\mbox{}\\
    \noindent
    Proof of Claim 1: \\
    Let A, B, C be the vertices of the triangle $T$ and let X, Y, Z be the midpoints of the edge AB, AC and BC. An application of the newest vertex bisection refinement produces the triangle $\triangle{AXY}, \triangle{XBY}, \triangle{ZBY}$ and $\triangle{YZC}$. Consider the Fig 8 (left).
    Since X, Y, Z be the midpoints of the edge AB, AC and BC, we have 
    \begin{align*}
     XY \parallel BC,
     \quad 
     ZY \parallel AB,
     \quad 
     AX = BX, 
     \quad 
     BZ = CZ, 
     \quad
     AY = CY
    \end{align*}
    Since $XY\parallel BC$, we have $\angle{AXY} = \angle{ABC}$ and $\angle{XYB} = \angle{ZBY}$. Similarly, since $ZY\parallel AB$, we have $\angle{YZC} = \angle{ABC}$ and $\angle{XBY} = \angle{ZYB}$. Thus 
    \begin{align*}
    \angle{XYB} = \angle{ZBY},
    \quad
    |BY| = |BY|,
    \quad
    \angle{XBY} &= \angle{ZYB}.
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, we have $\triangle{XBY} \cong \triangle{ZYB}$, and we mark them in the congruency class 4. This further gives us $|AX| = |BX| = |YZ|$, and $|ZC| = |BZ| = |XY|$.
    \begin{align*}
    |AX| = |YZ|,
    \quad
    \angle{AXY} = \angle{ABC} = {YZC},
    \quad
    |XY| = |ZC|.
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, we have $\triangle{AXY} \cong \triangle{YZC}$. It's clear that $\triangle{AXY}$ and $\triangle{YZC}$ are similar to $\triangle{ABC}$ as all their angles are the same. Thus, we finished the proof of claim 1.

    %\end{proof}%end proof of claim 1

    \begin{claim}
    Triangles with same number in Stage 4 in a same congruency class marked by the number.
    \end{claim}
    %\begin{proof}
    \noindent
    Proof of Claim 2: \\
    Let A, B, C be the vertices of the triangle $T$ and let X, Y, Z be the midpoints of the edge AB, AC and BC, and M, N, P be the midpoints of the edge AY, CY and BY. Consider the Fig 8 (right).
 
    An application of the newest vertex bisection refinement produces the following triangles
    \begin{align*}
    \triangle{AXM}, \triangle{XBP}, \triangle{ZYP}, \triangle{YZN}, \triangle{MXY}, \triangle{PBZ}, \triangle{PYX}, \triangle{NZC}
    \end{align*}
    Notice that X, P and Z are three points one a stright line. This is clear because $XP\parallel AY$ and $PZ\parallel YC$, and we have $\angle{BPX}+\angle{BPZ} = \angle{BYA}+\angle{BYC} = \pi$. Basically, to prove the Stage 4 is equivalent to prove the following
    \begin{align*}
    \triangle{AXM}\cong\triangle{XBP}\cong\triangle{ZYP}\cong\triangle{YZN}\\
    \triangle{MXY}\cong\triangle{PBZ}\cong\triangle{PYX}\cong\triangle{NZC}
    \end{align*}
    Similarily to proof of Claim 1, we have
    \begin{align*}
    XY\parallel BC,
    \quad
    YZ\parallel AB,
    \quad
    XZ\parallel AC,
    \quad
    XM\parallel BY\parallel ZN
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, we further have 
    \begin{align*}
    \angle{BAY} = \angle{ZYC},
    \quad
    \angle{BCY} = \angle{XYA},
    \quad
    \angle{AXC} = \angle{ABC} = \angle{YZC}\\
    \angle{PZY} = \angle{ZYN},
    \quad
    \angle{PYZ} = \angle{NZP},
    \quad
    \angle{PXY} = \angle{XYM},
    \quad
    \angle{PYX} = \angle{MXY},
    \end{align*}
    Then it is clear that
    \begin{align*}
    \triangle{AXY} \sim \triangle{ABC} \sim \triangle{YZC}
    \end{align*}
    Similarly, we can find that 
    \begin{align*}
    \triangle{XBZ}\sim\triangle{ABC},
    \quad
    \triangle{AXM}\sim\triangle{ABY},
    \quad
    \triangle{CZN}\sim\triangle{CBY}.
    \end{align*}
    In other words, 
    \begin{align*}
    \triangle{AXM}\sim\triangle{ABY}\sim\triangle{XBP}\sim\triangle{YZN},\\
    \triangle{CZN}\sim\triangle{CBY}\sim\triangle{YXM}\sim\triangle{ZBP}.
    \end{align*}
    Moreover, since the ratio of $\|AX\|, \|BX\|$, and $\|ZY\|$ is 1, and the ratio of $\|ZC\|, \|BZ\|$, and $\|XY\|$ is 1, we have
    \begin{align*}
    \triangle{AXM}\cong\triangle{XBP}\cong\triangle{YZN},\\
    \triangle{CZN}\cong\triangle{YXM}\sim\triangle{ZBP}.
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, we showed that $\triangle{AXM}, \triangle{XBP}$ and $\triangle{YZN}$ are in congruency class 2, and $\triangle{CZN}, \triangle{YXM}$ and $\triangle{ZBP}$ are in congruency class 3.
    Moreover, since 
    \begin{align*}
    \angle{PZY} = \angle{ZYN},
    \quad
    \angle{PYZ} = \angle{NZP},
    \quad
    \angle{PXY} = \angle{XYM},
    \quad
    \angle{PYX} = \angle{MXY},
    \end{align*}
    we have that
    \begin{align*}
    \triangle{YZN}\cong\triangle{YZP},
    \quad
    \triangle{YXM}\cong\triangle{YXP}.
    \end{align*}
    Therefore we proved 
    \begin{align*}
    \triangle{AXM}\cong\triangle{XBP}\cong\triangle{ZYP}\cong\triangle{YZN}\sim\triangle{ABY},\\
    \triangle{MXY}\cong\triangle{PBZ}\cong\triangle{PYX}\cong\triangle{NZC}\sim\triangle{YBC}.
    \end{align*}
    %\end{proof}
    Thus, we finished proof of Claim 2.

    \label{Fig8}
    \end{figure}



    Notice that in Stage 3, we see triangles in congruency class 1 again, so we can tell further applying the newest vertex bisection refinement will lead to the same process as what we have for Stage 1. Similarly, further applying the newest vertex bisection refinement over triangles in congruency class 4, 2 and 3 are already explored in Stage 3 and 4. Therefore, we actually obtain 4 congruency classes only.
    \end{proof}
    This means that we never have triangles degenerating when applying the newest vertex bisection refinement, because the number of congruence classes is four, which is finite, and by theorem proved in 3.1, we see that the newest vertex bisection refinement strategy is stable.

    As we explain in section 3, a good refinement strategy should preserve both stability and consistency. Before we take a look at consistency, let's first introduce dependency graph.

    \subsection{Compatible Divisibility and Consistency}
    \begin{definition*}
      Let G = (N, A) be a simple directed graph, where N(nodes) represents triangles, and $(n_1, n_2)\in A (arrows)$ if the refinement edge of $n_1$ neighbors at $n_2$, and then we call G a dependency graph.
      \begin{align*}
      N &= \{T\in\mathcal{T}~\mid~\diam{T} = 2\}\\
      A &= \{(V_1, V_2)\in V\times V | \text{The refinement edge of $V_1$ neighbors $V_2$}\}
      \end{align*}
    \end{definition*}
    Note that $G$ is a simple directed graph, so it does not contain any loops. That is, for all $(v_1, v_2)\in A$, we have $v_1\neq v_2$. Moreover, all nodes of one dependency graph have at most one outgoing arrow, because every triangle $T$ has at most exactly one refinement edge(See Figure 9). If the refinement edge of $T$ borders no other triangles, then there is no arrow going from $T$ to any other triangles in the dependency graph. If oppositely, it borders another triangle $T'$ along its refinement edge, then there is an arrow in G going from $T$ to $T'$.  %[Multiple V's, graph? need proof???]

    \begin{lemma*}
    A node n in the dependency graph has no outgoing arrow if and only if the corresponding triangle of n has a refinement edge at the boundary.
    \end{lemma*}
    The proof for this is trivial based on the explanation for G as simple graph.

    \begin{definition*}
      A triangle is called compatibly divisible if either
      \begin{itemize}
        \item[a. ] it has no outgoing edge in G
        \item[b. ] it is part of a cycle in G whose size is 2.

    \end{figure}
    In \ref{Fig11}, we see a compatibility chain in a triangulation. When performing the newest vertex bisection on the right most triangle, we need to bisect its left neighboring triangle first. We obtain a recursion here since we need to bisect the triangle which our current target triangle depends on. If we successfully reached the base case, either on boundary or a cycle of size 2, we can then bisect back in an order like stack. In the example displayed in \ref{Fig11}, a base case is reached by bisecting the left most two triangles. However, a base case is not always promised. In other word, it is not guaranteed that we can always achieve either bisection on the boundary or a cycle of size 2. One example is displayed in \ref{Fig12}, and this failed in applying the newest vertex bisection, because smaller triangles are dependent on each other. That is, its dependency graph is a cycle instead of a forest, i.e. collection of trees.

    \begin{lemma*}
    If the newest vertex bisection is only performed on 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[a. ] triangles isolated in the dependency graph
        \item[b. ] pairs of mates
      \end{itemize}
    then the refinement is stable and the triangulations will be consistent.
    \end{lemma*}
    \begin{proof}
    We already proved stability in general in two dimension, and this applies here as well under a more strict condition. The consistency is obvious in compatibility divisible triangles. More specifically, if all triangles $T$ of the initial simplicial complex $\mathcal T$ are compatibly divisible, then the number of recursion is bounded. That is, we never have a cyclic dependency graph like Figure\ref{Fig12}. A detailed proof can be found in \cite{mitchell1988unified, mitchell1991adaptive}.
    \end{proof}

    \paragraph{Initial Refinement Edge}\mbox{}\\
    As described in newest vertex bisection algorithm, the start point is to pick the first peak which decides the first refinement edge. However, a determining question in this process is how we choose the first peak and initial refinement edge to produce stable and consistent triangulation after each recursion. More specifically, since we know the newest vertex bisection preserves stability generally and consistency if its dependency graph is a forest instead of cycles, the question is how to determine the initial refinement edge to promise a forest-like dependency graph. 

    By lemma above, a good answer to this question is to choose an initial mesh whose triangles are all compatibly divisible. One approach to have a such choice is to choose the longest edge of each triangle in the initial simplicial complex $\mathcal T$ as the refinement edge. A consistency is proved using this approach in Kossaczky's paper \cite{kossaczky1994recursive}. Basically, he proved that the dependency graph of $\mathcal T$ is acyclic with longest edge of triangles $T\in\mathcal T$ as refinement edge.
